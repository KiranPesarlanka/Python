    "You’ll find that, as you add more and more tests, your single file will become cluttered and hard to maintain, so you can create a folder called tests/ and split the tests into multiple files. It is convention to ensure each file starts with test_ so all test runners will assume that Python file contains tests to be executed. Some very large projects split tests into more subdirectories based on their purpose or usage.\n"
